<h1>HW1 Submission</h1>
<p>From this course, I hope to gain a deep <em>understanding</em> of both making websites with HTML, javascript, and CSS, as well as <strong>website deployment.</strong>
    I've had minimal experience with websites and haven't done much with deployment either. This class is also giving me my first experience 
    using <em>GitHub pages</em> which I hadn't heard of before taking this course. Overall, I'm excited about taking this course, and getting my first
    real experience with web <strong>development.</strong>
